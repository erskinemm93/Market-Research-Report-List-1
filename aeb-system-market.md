<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The AEB System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Forward Collision Warning</li><li>Dynamic Brake Support</li><li>Crash Imminent Braking</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Advanced Emergency Braking (AEB) system market consists of three main types: Forward Collision Warning (FCW), Dynamic Brake Support (DBS), and Crash Imminent Braking (CIB). FCW alerts drivers of potential collisions, providing an early warning to mitigate risks. DBS offers assistance by automatically applying brakes if the driver fails to respond promptly. CIB goes a step further by activating full braking to prevent or reduce the severity of a collision when an impact is imminent. Together, these technologies enhance vehicle safety.</p></p>
