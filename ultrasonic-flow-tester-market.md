<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ultrasonic Flow Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-Intrusive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ultrasonic flow testers are categorized into two main types: intrusive and non-intrusive. Intrusive ultrasonic flow testers require physical contact with the fluid, typically through insertion into the pipeline, providing high accuracy for measuring flow rates. In contrast, non-intrusive ultrasonic flow testers operate externally, using ultrasonic signals transmitted through the pipe wall to measure flow without disturbing the fluid. This makes non-intrusive testers ideal for applications where maintaining system integrity is crucial, or where pipeline access is limited.</p></p>
